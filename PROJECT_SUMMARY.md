## ✨ Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Automatic Artifact Parsing**: Reads and organizes artifact folders
- ✅ **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Dual-column view of main vs feature branches
- ✅ **Visual Diff Highlighting**: Color-coded changes
- ✅ **Cell-Level Differences**: Highlights exact cells that changed in CSV files
- ✅ **Real-Time Statistics**: Shows counts of added/removed/modified lines
- ✅ **Tenant Organization**: Groups related comparisons together
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet screens

### User Experience
- ✅ **Beautiful Modern UI**: Gradient design with smooth animations
- ✅ **Intuitive Navigation**: Click-to-compare interface
- ✅ **Active State Indicators**: Shows currently selected file
- ✅ **Loading States**: User feedback during operations
- ✅ **Empty States**: Clear guidance when no comparison is selected

### Technical Features
- ✅ **Python Backend**: Flask-based REST API
- ✅ **Pure JavaScript Frontend**: No external dependencies
- ✅ **CSV Parsing**: Handles comma-separated value files
- ✅ **Line-by-Line Comparison**: Detailed diff algorithm
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with user feedback

## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Color Scheme
- **Purple Gradient Header**: Modern, professional look
- **Yellow (Modified)**: ⚠️ Changed lines that need attention
- **Blue (Added)**: ℹ️ New lines in feature branch
- **Red (Removed)**: ❌ Lines removed from main branch
- **Gray (Unchanged)**: ✓ Identical lines

### Layout
- **Three-Column Design**: Line numbers, Main branch, Feature branch
- **Sticky Headers**: Column headers remain visible while scrolling
- **Expandable Sidebar**: Organized folder navigation
- **Stats Dashboard**: Quick overview of changes

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Backend (Flask)
1. **Artifact Discovery**: Scans the artifacts directory
2. **File Pairing**: Matches `-feat` and `-main` files
3. **Comparison Engine**: Line-by-line diff with cell-level analysis
4. **REST API**: Serves structure and comparison data as JSON

### Frontend (JavaScript)
1. **Fetch Structure**: Loads artifact organization on page load
2. **Render Sidebar**: Creates interactive file browser
3. **Handle Clicks**: Fetches comparison data when file is selected
4. **Display Results**: Renders side-by-side comparison with highlighting

## 📊 API Endpoints

### GET `/`
Returns the main HTML interface

### GET `/api/structure`
Returns artifact directory structure as JSON:
```json
{
  "508": {
    "CHART-426": {"feat": "CHART-426-feat", "main": "CHART-426-main"},
    "CHART-481": {"feat": "CHART-481-feat", "main": "CHART-481-main"}
  }
}
```

### GET `/api/compare?folder=508&id=CHART-426`
Returns comparison data:
```json
{
  "comparison": [
    {
      "line_num": 1,
      "feat": "metrics.ARR...",
      "main": "metrics.ARR...",
      "status": "modified",
      "cell_diffs": [...]
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "total_lines": 10,
    "same": 0,
    "modified": 10,
    "added": 0,
    "removed": 0
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/upload` (Future Enhancement)
Upload and extract artifact ZIP files

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Artifacts Location
Default: `/Users/yeltsinz/Downloads/regression-diffs (1)`

To change, edit `app.py`:
```python
ARTIFACTS_DIR = Path("/your/custom/path")
```

### Server Port
Default: `5001`

To change, edit `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, port=YOUR_PORT)
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **Flask 3.0.0**: Web framework
- **Werkzeug 3.0.1**: WSGI utilities

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Review Tenant 508
```
1. Open http://localhost:5001
2. Click "📁 Tenant 508"
3. Click "CHART-426" to see comparison
4. Review the 10 modified lines
5. Click "CHART-481" to see next comparison
```

### Example 2: Identify Critical Changes
```
1. Look at statistics dashboard
2. High "Modified" count = significant changes
3. Click through files with most changes
4. Examine yellow-highlighted cells
```
